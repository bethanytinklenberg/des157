    The New York Times article titled “Yes, Looks Do Matter,” discusses the reasons as to why we as humans, have a tendency to judge others based on their looks. According to the article, the basis of this trait originated back when we were hunter-gatherers and cave-dwellers, where we needed to look at something and be able to identify what it was and what its intentions were, in a matter of seconds. Physical attractiveness can be tied to higher social adeptness, high intelligence levels, and strong leadership capabilities, even if the person in question has none of the aforementioned abilities.

    In the Stanford article, researchers found the cure to poor mental state and low mental health--nature. The study found that “people who walked for 90 minutes in a natural area, as opposed to participants who walked in a high-traffic urban setting, showed decreased activity in a region of the brain associated with a key factor in depression.” Gregory Bratman, a graduate student at Stanford, stated the following. “This finding is exciting because it demonstrates the impact of nature experience on an aspect of emotion regulation – something that may help explain how nature makes us feel better.”

    With the link in mental happiness and being in nature, I believe that the medium of digital flowers that I am pursuing could prove to be a highly beneficial environment for shanghai, which is such a highly populated, highly urban area. Also reading about how we as humans have a natural tendency to judge people by appearance rather than by character or individual skill or kindness, I believe that an impartial medium, such as floral blooms, could stimulate conversation and excitement about how diverse the world is.
