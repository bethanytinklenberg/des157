      <p> Humanity is beautiful. Every individual is unique and lovely in their own way. With the increase in depression due to physical insecurities, this project aims to display humanity in an objective manner, with individuals represented as flowers. In this app, you will create a flower that you feel represents yourself. Once completed, will add it to the exhibition that you see before you.
        This interactive and immersive exhibition is to show that, although research has come out in recent months regarding how anxiety and depression levels increase when surrounded by technology, not all immersive technology has to be stressful. Please enjoy the exhibition, knowing that each of the flowers represents someone who was here before you; a beautiful person created just as unique, complex, wonderful, and loved as you are.
