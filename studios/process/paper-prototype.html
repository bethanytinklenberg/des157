      These screens show the user flow for the application that would partner with my immersive installation. The user engages a avatar-builder for a flower. The flower has multiple options for size, shape, color, leaves, and decorations.
      Once the user has selected all the choices, they can select the "done" button and send their flower avatar to the database, where it will turn up on the projection and be added to the collection of flowers.

      User feedback during this session was to make the icons really clear in the navigation bar as well as add an undo button in case the user made a mistake. I was also told to add the "done" button outside of the navigation so that the user could be finished before they made it through the entire navigation.
      It was also recommended that I create the flowers in P5 so that there is a lot of options for the user to generate an avatar that they feel describes them.
