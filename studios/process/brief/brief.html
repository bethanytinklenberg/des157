<h1>Research</h1>
<p>
The New York Times article titled <em>“Yes, Looks Do Matter,”</em> discusses the reasons as to why we as humans, have a tendency to judge others based on their looks. According to the article, the basis of this trait originated back when we were hunter-gatherers and cave-dwellers, where we needed to look at something and be able to identify what it was and what its intentions were, in a matter of seconds. Physical attractiveness can be tied to higher social adeptness, high intelligence levels, and strong leadership capabilities, even if the person in question has none of the aforementioned abilities. In the Stanford article titled <em>“Nature’s Benefits”</em>, researchers found the cure to poor mental state and low mental health--nature. The study found that “people who walked for 90 minutes in a natural area, as opposed to participants who walked in a high-traffic urban setting, showed decreased activity in a region of the brain associated with a key factor in depression.” Gregory Bratman, a graduate student at Stanford, stated the following. “This finding is exciting because it demonstrates the impact of nature experience on an aspect of emotion regulation – something that may help explain how nature makes us feel better.” With the link in mental happiness and being in nature, I believe that the medium of digital flowers that I am pursuing could prove to be a highly beneficial environment for shanghai, which is such a highly populated, highly urban area. Also reading about how we as humans have a natural tendency to judge people by appearance rather than by character or individual skill or kindness, I believe that an impartial medium, such as floral blooms, could stimulate conversation and excitement about how diverse the world is.
My project focuses on using a universal plant, the flower, to showcase the beauty of diversity in humanity. In researching other art similar to this project goal, I found the work of Jennifer Steinkamp and TeamLab. TeamLab, a digital art group from Japan, has exhibitions throughout the world that use processing to create interactive displays based on nature. Jennifer Steinkamp, a UCLA Design and Media Arts professor and digital exhibition artists, creates interactive and digital 3D space installations. The two artists have very similar styles with their floral displays &mdash the likes of which I am interested in creating a display. Both Steincamp and teamLab display their installations in public, interactive spaces, in addition to museums. Jennifer Steinkamp has had her work displayed in Times Square in New York, as well as other outdoor exhibitions, and teamLab has displayed their art in tea houses, on castle walls, and in gardens. Steinkamp’s work reflects fruit, feathers, and floral blooms in colorful, digital fields. In comparison to the work done by teamLab, it tends to take on a slightly more 3D effect. Her projects in the fruit series seem to have a little more depth and graphic shape than those of teamLab. Then again, some of her projects take on very clear visual likeness to that of the teamLab installations. TeamLab is known for its soft hues, dark backgrounds, and interactivity. They use processing to create many of their installations, which include wall and full-room projections. I have had the privilege to visit one of their installations and it was an ethereal, immersive experience that transported you between environments; a stormy ocean, a field of blooms, a trickling waterfall, and a galaxy of stars.

<h1>Target Audience</h1>
<p>
The target audience for the project is truly, diverse. The aim for the demo is that anyone can use it, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, or language spoken. The demo is meant to serve as visualization for the diversity of those who come to DIS, who represent people from the entire globe. The interface is user-friendly, so that kids and adults alike can interact with and enjoy the experience.
</p>

<h1>Description of Form</h1>
<p>
	The demo takes two forms. First, a user interacts with a digital interface on a phone or tablet. This interface allows the user to create a flower that they believe represents them. Next, the user sends the flower to the second part of the exhibition. Here, the user can see their flower displayed amongst many other flowers. The floral exhibit would be projected onto one or more walls to create a beautiful, diverse, and immersive environment. This would first display the aspect of diversity, and how we judge others based on appearances. The flowers would go to show that there is much more that unites humanity than divides it. Similar to how all flowers are flowers, the same, yet beautiful in their own way-- all humans, are the same, yet unique and beautiful in our own way. The immersive digital experience of the floral exhibition would address the second part of the problem--that living in an age where we are surrounded with technology, we are seeing increased anxiety and depression levels. This exhibition would serve as the antithesis to this issue, as it aims to create a space where, although technology is surrounding you, you feel peace and joy.
